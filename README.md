## Overview

Auto-Hacker demonstrates how large language models (LLMs), such as GPT-4, can autonomously hack websites. This project is based on the paper "[LLM Agents can Autonomously Hack Websites](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06664)" by Richard Fang, Rohan Bindu, Akul Gupta, Qiusi Zhan, and Daniel Kang. Currently it only supports SQL injection.

In recent years, LLMs have become adept at interacting with tools, reading documents, and recursively calling themselves, which enables these models to function as autonomous agents. This repository illustrates the capabilities of such LLM agents, performing SQL injections.

**Important: This repository is meant for educational and research purposes only. Always obtain proper authorization before hacking any website.**

## Installation

### Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- OpenAI API key (for GPT-4 access)
- Required Python packages listed in `requirements.txt` (Can be installed with provided shell script)

### Steps

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/isaac-0414/auto-hacker.git
   cd auto-hacker
   ```

2. Create a `.env` file with your OpenAI API key
   ```env
   OPENAI_API_KEY=YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY
   ```
   
## Usage

### Basic Usage

1. For Mac users
   ```bash
   ./run.sh
   ```
2. For Windows users
   ```cmd
   ./run.bat
   ```

3. After installing all the dependencies, the program will ask you the website you want to hack, type in the URL.

## Testing

I provide 3 sandbox websites that can run on your localhost with a MySQL database. All the websites will runs on http://localhost:3000/

1. Website 1: A simple login form (Express.js + MySQL)
   ```bash
   cd ./sandbox_websites/1
   ```
   
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
   
   ```bash
   npm run start
   ```

2. Website 2: A simple search form with no quotes in SQL query (Express.js + MySQL)
   ```bash
   cd ./sandbox_websites/2
   ```

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

   ```bash
   npm run start
   ```

3. Website 3: A more complicated website with a login form (React.js + Express.js + MySQL)
   ```bash
   cd ./sandbox_websites/3/frontend
   ```

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   ```bash
   cd ./sandbox_websites/3/backend
   ```

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

   ```bash
   npm run start
   ```

1. Demo 1: Hacking into the site with a simple login form
2. Demo 2: Trying 5 different SQL injection payloads until success
3. Demo 3: Hacking into a more complicated website with a lot of animations
